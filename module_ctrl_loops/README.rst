Description
-----------

This component provides three control loops for position, velocity and torque control. Each of these control modes has separate Server loop and Client functions. The control loops implemented are closed on data from sensors like position from hall sensor/qei sensor for Position/Velocity Controller; torque from current sensors for Torque Controller.

The Client provides functions to check status of the controller; update sensor related parameters needed by the controller; enable/shutdown controllers; set target values like position/velocity/torque for controllers; get actual values like position/velocity/torque.

To include this component add module\_ctrl\_loops to USED\_MODULES in the application/test makefile, and include the following header files for: Velocity Control: velocity\_ctrl\_client.h and velocity\_ctrl\_server.h Torque Control: torque\_ctrl\_client.h and torque\_ctrl\_server.h Position Control: position\_ctrl\_client.h and position\_ctrl\_server.h

Note: The controllers are not limited to only the sensors listed, for example if you have a different type of position sensor and is interfaced to the IFM, all it needs is a specific sensor driver running on IFM Core and respective client functions to read sensor information must be placed in controller implementation.
