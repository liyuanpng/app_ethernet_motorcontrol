Description
-----------

The BLDC Commutation Component provides a driver for BLDC motors, featuring an efficient sinusoidal commutation method. The component implements a Commutation-Server which requires motor angle information provided by a Hall effect sensor (see HALL server in module_hall) and commutates the motor. This component can be easily interfaced and used as a foundation for a custom motor control application. The component can be configured with several parameters like: commutation offset, motor winding type, nominal motor speed and number of pole pairs.
