Description
-----------

This module provides Motion profile generation and Profile control functions for position/velocity/torque control.

The profile generator provides functions to define the acceleration, deceleration, slopes in some cases, velocity; and generates a profile to match these requirements. Once initialized with these parameters the profile can be generated using respective profile\_generate function. Also profile generation for quick stop actions are provided. Note: the profiles generated are limited by parameters like max acceleration, max profile velocity or max/min allowed target value for the profile.

The Profile control functions makes use of the profile generators to create motion profiles and communicates the profile with the respective control Server.

To include this module add module\_profile to USED\_MODULES in the application/test makefile, and include header files: profile.h and profile\_control.h
